This is a repository to collect and share my favorite frontend bookmarks/links. It's the short version of my blog post [Frontend-Bookmarks](marcokuehbauch.com/blog/frontend-bookmarks) I wrote recently.
Feel free to suggest new resources, I'm always happy to discover something new!

* [MDN - Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the best online documentation about web technologies. I guess it is my most used frontend bookmark. I use it daily to look up different CSS properties, learn more about several JavaScript methods or which attributes belong to a specific HTML element. It's my central station for frontend development.

* [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/) is a great tool that provides you up-to-date browser support tables for support of fronted web technologies on desktop and mobile browsers.
