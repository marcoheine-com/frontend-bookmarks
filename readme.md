# frontend bookmarks

This is a repository to collect and share my favorite frontend bookmarks/links. It's the short version of my blog post [Frontend-Bookmarks]() I wrote recently.
Feel free to suggest new resources, I'm always happy to discover something new!

* [MDN - Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) The MDN is the best online documentation about web technologies. I guess it is my most used frontend bookmark. I use it daily to look up different CSS properties, learn more about several JavaScript methods or which attributes belong to a specific HTML element. It's my central station for frontend development.

* [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/) CanIUse is a great tool that provides you up-to-date browser support tables for support of fronted web technologies on desktop and mobile browsers. So in short if you would like to use a new technology and you are not sure if every browser supports it, CanIUse gives you the answer. 

* [PageSpeedInsights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) PageSpeedInsights analyzes your website, gives you insights on what's good and tipps on how to improve and do better. 

* [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is a playground for the front end web. It's a code editor in the browser where you can quickly write HTML, CSS and JS to try out an idea or a small project. It's also great for discover projects of others and explore and learn while reading their code.
